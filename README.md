# QAOAnsatz-for-MDS
Numerical experimental data for solving the Minimum Dominating Set problem based on the Quantum Alternation Operator Ansatz

Contains the experimental figures, experimental codes, and experimental result data of different vertex sizes used in this article. main (example).ipynb is the main file, which is the experimental code of the example used in the article. Other experimental codes are written in a similar way. MDS Classic Method.ipynb is a code written by the classic method for solving MDS problems.

Due to the large number of codes and result data of different vertex sizes, they are uploaded in the form of .zip files. If necessary, please download and view.
